## Profile

I design and deploy AI systems that move beyond experimentation into structured, production-ready solutions. My work spans LLM workflows, multi-agent architectures, deep learning for healthcare, and applied computer vision systems.

I am particularly interested in:
- Generative AI systems and LLM orchestration
- Machine Learning and Computer Vision
- AI reliability and evaluation
- Backend AI service deployment
